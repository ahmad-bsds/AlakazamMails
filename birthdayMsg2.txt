Hi [Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and say hello. It's been a while since we've connected, and I wanted to let you know that you've been on my mind.

Life can get busy, but it's important to remember the people who matter most to us. You are one of those people, and I wanted to take a moment to let you know that I appreciate you and the impact you've had on my life.

I hope you're doing well and that life is treating you kindly. If there's anything you need or if you ever want to catch up, feel free to reach out. I'm always here for you.

Take care and have a great day.

Sincerely,

MUHAMMAD AHMAD
